# Apache Sentry

## Overview 

[Apache Sentry](https://sentry.apache.org/) is a granular, role-based authorization module for Hadoop. Sentry provides the ability to control and enforce precise levels of privileges on data for authenticated users and applications on a Hadoop cluster. Sentry currently works out of the box with Apache Hive, Hive Metastore/HCatalog, Apache Solr, Impala and HDFS (limited to Hive table data). Sentry is designed to be a pluggable authorization engine for Hadoop components. It allows you to define authorization rules to validate a user or applicationâ€™s access requests for Hadoop resources. Sentry is highly modular and can support authorization for a wide variety of data models in Hadoop.
