# Considerations  

## Performance
  
- ZK nodes must have network latency in order of single digit milli-seconds. Any challenges here will impact performance of the application its supporting. Ensure that VMs supporting ZK are deployed within the same region.
  
- ZK leverages VM memory and local storage to achieve high performance. Consider using managed disks with premium storage with memory of at least 12-16 GB memory per VM.  
  
- Consider using separate SSDs for storing snapshots and logs generated by ZK. At a bare minimum, separate Azure Managed Disks must be used for ZK snapshots and logs.

## Reliability
  
- For production deployments, we recommend using an ensemble of 5 ZK nodes. From HA perspective, these should be deployed in different Azure Availability Zones (AZ). If AZs are not available, deploy ensemble in an Availability Set (AvSet).
