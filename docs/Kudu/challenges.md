Common challenges associated with Kudu deployments:

* Complexity - It needs to be configured as an additional storage layer to benefit from great features, adding more complexity to the Hadoop ecosystem, which originally has complex features.
* Due to the nature of using memory for various operations, it is not possible to completely separate compute and storage.
* Ageing infrastructure - End-of-support of hardware requires replacement and upgrade. 
* Capacity - Scale can be difficult depending on hardware and data center capacity.
* Lack of native tools that enable:  

  * Cost transparency  
  * Monitoring  
  * DevOps  
  * Automation
