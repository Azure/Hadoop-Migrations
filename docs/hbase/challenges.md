# Challenges of HBase on premise  

Common challenges associated with HBase deployments:

* Scalability
  * It can be difficult depending on hardware and data center capacity.
* Ageing infrastructure
  * End of support forces customers to replace or migrate their hardwares.
* Hard to achieve HA-DR due lack of data-centre sites.
  * It has a single point of failure. If Master node goes down complete cluster fails. HA-DR is hard to implement.
* Productivity
  * On-premises Hadoop ecosystem is complex, hard to manage and prone to failures.
* Lack of native tools that enable:  
  * Cost transparency
  * Monitoring
  * DevOps
  * Automation
