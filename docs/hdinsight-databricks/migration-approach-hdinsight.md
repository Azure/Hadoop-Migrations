# Migration Approach

## Assessment

## Considerations

**HDInsight Spark:**
Azure HDInsight as "A cloud-based service from Microsoft for big data analytics". It is a cloud-based service from Microsoft for big data analytics that helps organizations process large amounts of streaming or historical data.

**Main features from the HDInsight platform:**
* Fully managed
* Variety of services for multiple porpuses
* Open-source analytics servicefro entreprise companies

**Synapse Spark:**
Azure Synapse Analytics takes the best of Azure SQL Data Warehouse and modernizes it by providing more functionalities for the SQL developers such as adding querying with serverless SQL pool, adding machine learning support, embedding Apache Spark natively, providing collaborative notebooks, and offering data integration within a single service. In addition to the languages supported by Apache Spark, Synapse Spark also support C#.

**Synapse Spark Primary Use-Cases**

1. Consolidated type of nodes for starters to pick e.g., Small, Medium, Large node types compared to different node types.

2. Ephemeral Jobs: Synapse spark is built for short term processing and hence all the cluster have a TTL (Time to Live) and are automatically terminated to save costs.

3. Support for both reading and writing into Synapse tables.

4. Built in support for .NET for spark application enables existing user skill set to take advantage of Apache Spark distributed data processing.

5. Unified security and monitoring features including Managed VNets throughout all workloads with one Azure Synapse workspace

6. Existing spark user to take advantage of Microsoft proprietary optimizations e.g., Hyperspace: An indexing subsystem for Apache Spark.

**Main features from Azure Synapse:**
* Complete T-SQL based analytics
* Hybrid data integration
* Apache Spark integration
HDInsight and Synapse Spark are using the same version of Apache Spark 3.1, that is a good starting point when we try to performa a migration from different platform.
as we are using the same Spark version code and jars will be able to deploy in Synapse easily.

[Azure Synapse Runtime for Apache Spark 3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-3-runtime)

[Azure HDInsight Runtime for Apache Spark 3.1](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/analytics-on-azure-blog/spark-3-1-is-now-generally-available-on-hdinsight/ba-p/3253679)

HDInsight is a service that is always up and we have to understand deeply the service to be able to configure and tunned , that make the service complex compare with others.Most of HDInsights features are Apache based. There are several cluster types to choose from depending upon your need.

On the other hand Synapse is consumption-based, and is easier to configurate.Synapse incorporates many other Azure services and is the main plaform for Analytics and Data Orchestration.

### Performance Considerations

Refer to [Optimize Spark jobs for performance - Azure Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance) for considerations.

## Planning

## Migration Approach

Azure has several landing targets for Apache Spark. Depending on requirements and product features, customers can choose between Azure Synapse, Azure Databricks and Azure HDInsight.

### Migration Scenarios

1. Moving from On-premises Hadoop -> Use Synapse migration as the primary migration strategy and Synapse Spark for ad-hoc queries and processing.

2. Moving from On-premises Data Warehouse (Teradata, Netezza etc.) to Synapse Spark -> Follow Synapse migration path

### Creating an Apache Spark Pool

An Apache Spark pool in your Synapse Workspace provides Spark environment to load data, model process and get faster insights.

Reference Link: [QuickStart: Create a serverless Apache Spark pool using the Azure portal - Azure Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-apache-spark-pool-portal)

### Spark Instances

Spark instances are created when you connect to a Spark pool, create a session, and run a job. As multiple users may have access to a single Spark pool, a new Spark instance is created for each user that connects.

Examples on how the spark pools behave are shown below, Spark pools need to be created based on the usage type.

**Example 1**

* You create a Spark pool called SP1; it has a fixed cluster size of 20 nodes.

* You submit a notebook job, J1 that uses 10 nodes, a Spark instance, SI1 is created to process the job.

* You now submit another job, J2, that uses 10 nodes because there is still capacity in the pool and the instance, the J2, is processed by SI1.

* If J2 had asked for 11 nodes, there would not have been capacity in SP1 or SI1. In this case, if J2 comes from a notebook, then the job will be rejected; if J2 comes from a batch job, then it will be queued.

**Example 2**

* You create a Spark pool call SP2; it has an auto scale enabled 10 â€“ 20 nodes.

* You submit a notebook job, J1 that uses 10 nodes, a Spark instance, SI1, is created to process the job.

* You now submit another job, J2, that uses 10 nodes, because there is still capacity in the pool the instance auto grows to 20 nodes and processes J2.

**Example 3**

* You create a Spark pool called SP1; it has a fixed cluster size of 20 nodes.

* You submit a notebook job, J1 that uses 10 nodes, a Spark instance, SI1 is created to process the job.

* Another user, U2, submits a Job, J3, that uses 10 nodes, a new Spark instance, SI2, is created to process the job.
* You now submit another job, J2, that uses 10 nodes because there's still capacity in the pool and the instance, J2, is processed by SI1.

>[!NOTE] Each Synapse workspace has a default quota limit at the Workspace level and also at the Spark pool level. These requirements need to be captured during the assessment phase (Infrastructure)

### Performance Considerations

Refer to [Optimize Spark jobs for performance - Azure Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/apache-spark-performance) for considerations.

### Data Storage:

Spark is a processing framework and does not store any data, once the processing is complete an appropriate sink needs to be chosen.

| Use case            | Sink                 | Comment        |Reference Links|
| ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------  |--------------|
| Data Warehouse      | Synapse table        |                 |[Import and Export data between serverless Apache Spark pools and SQL pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/synapse-spark-sql-pool-import-export)               |


### Data Migration:

Synapse Spark supports reading multiple different file formats (ORC, Parquet etc.) so use the same migration strategy as on-premises HDFS migration.

Internal migration from Synapse SQL Pool to Synapse Spark Pool is documented in detail at [Import and Export data between serverless Apache Spark pools and SQL pools - Azure Synapse Analytics | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/spark/synapse-spark-sql-pool-import-export)

### Ingesting SQL pool data into a Spark database

1. Create Notebook (default language is pyspark)

2. If we need to read table create in Synapse (sqlpool001.dbo.TaxiTrip)

```sql
%%spark

spark.sql ("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sparknyc")

val df = spark. read. sqlanalytics("sqlpool001.dbo.TaxiTrip")

df. write. mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("sparknyc.taxitrip")
```

3. Now you can use the regular dataframe operation to perform transformations.

### Ingesting Spark table data into an SQL pool table

1. Create Notebook (default language is pyspark)

2. to create a synapse table, execute as below.

```sql
%%spark

val df = spark.sql ("SELECT * FROM sparknyc. passengerstats")

df. write. sqlanalytics("sqlpool001.dbo.PassengerStats",Constants.INTERNAL)
```

3. Now you can use the regular dataframe operation to perform transformations.

## Metadata migration
**Shared Metadata**
Azure Synapse Analytics allows the different workspace computational engines to share databases and Parquet-backed tables between its Apache Spark pools and serverless SQL pool. More information is available from the below link
